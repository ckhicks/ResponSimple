### ResponSimple is a simplistic approach to WordPress themes.

The idea here is to give you a solid starting point for building websites. Right now, the theme is in "functional" state - consider this a beta release.

The famous [HTML5 Reset](http://github.com/murtaugh/HTML5-Reset "HTML5 Reset") toolkit is included here - I maintain [the WordPress version](https://github.com/murtaugh/HTML5-Reset-Wordpress-Theme "HTML5 Reset WordPress Theme") and thought it would be a nice addition. ResponSimple has been "normalizing" browser styles since day one, but this was a theme for people who wanted to start with a blank canvas, so a reset makes more sense.

Take some time to examine the code and contribute fixes/ideas/etc. This may also becoming a Squarespace developer template in the future...stay tuned!
