### ResponSimple is a simplistic approach to WordPress themes.

The idea here is to give you a solid starting point for building websites; even if all you know are terms like mobile first, responsive design, progressive enhancement, or fluid grid-based layouts, this is a good launchpad for your work. It even has some *simple* shortcodes and admin menus for the run-and-gun types.

I just finished adding the famous [HTML5 Reset](http://github.com/murtaugh/HTML5-Reset "HTML5 Reset") toolkit into the theme. Since I maintain [the WordPress version](https://github.com/murtaugh/HTML5-Reset-Wordpress-Theme "HTML5 Reset WordPress Theme") of Reset, I thought it would be a good idea to link the two projects together. ResponSimple has been "normalizing" browser styles since day one, but this was a theme for people who wanted to start with a blank canvas, so a reset makes more sense.

Right now, the theme is in "functional" state - consider this a beta release. Take some time to examine the code and [contact me](mailto:contact@ckhicks.com "Email CK Hicks") if you need anything. This may also becoming a Squarespace developer template in the near future...stay tuned!
